# Wuma VPN : Free, Fair, Stable usable by everyone


> Q1. Why can't YouTube and other network intensive tasks be done on some servers/regions?

Playing videos and downloading files will produce a lot of network traffic slowing down the network speed of other users connected to the same region, This is not fair for other users connected. If you do want to use these services, don't worry! We also provide some Video dedicated VPN regions. You will find them at the second VPN region group. These regions are based on CDN technologies which allow you to use these services. Please set the video quality to 480P if you intend to use our service for an extended time. Not doing this may result in your device being removed from the network.

 
> Q2. Why does the VPN service automatically disconnect every 30 minutes?

The number of connections and performance of the VPN servers are limited so a large number of connections may result in the server crashing. This is a flaw in many other VPN services we realize so we designed Wuma VPN to automatically disconnect users after 30 minutes releasing the load on the server and allowing for other users to connect. If you want to use it after being disconnected, you just need to go back to Wuma VPN app and connect.

> Q3:Is Wuma VPN free and safe?

Wuma VPN is 100% free requiring no money or credit card. You have unlimited time and bandwidth solong as P2P and Bittorrent services are not used. Wuma VPN can help protect your internet security and privacy. We will never steal any users information!
